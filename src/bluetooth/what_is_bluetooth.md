* **Core Concepts:**
    * **BDAddr:** Unique identifier for each Bluetooth device.
    * **Services & Characteristics:** Services group related functionalities, and characteristics hold specific information within a service.
    * **Data Exchange:** Read data from characteristics, potentially write data, or subscribe for updates.

* **Applications:** BLE empowers a wide range of applications in wearables, smart homes, mobile accessories, and more.

## What is Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology that allows devices to connect and communicate with each other. It uses radio waves to exchange data over a relatively short distance, typically up to 10 meters (33 feet) for most devices. Here are some key points about Bluetooth:

* **Wireless convenience:** Bluetooth eliminates the need for cables, making it easier to connect devices like headphones, speakers, keyboards, and phones.
* **Data exchange:**  It enables devices to share information, such as transferring files between phones or streaming music to wireless speakers.
* **Low power consumption:**  Compared to other wireless technologies like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth is designed to be energy efficient, making it ideal for battery-powered devices.
* **Simple pairing:**  Most Bluetooth devices are easy to pair with each other, often requiring a simple confirmation step.
